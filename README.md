I have used genetic algorithms in both MATLAB and Python for this optimization.

# Problem Description

## System

Using genetic algorithms, find K1:4 and C1:4 so that the cost function gets minimized.

try out the following conditions for MATLAB:
* Default settings
* Change population type to "bit string"
* Change population size to 500
* 
*

## Cost Function



# Solution

First, we need to drive matrices of this system. You can find my solution [here]().


## MATLAB

## Python

The library used for this part is ![geneticalgorithm](https://pypi.org/project/geneticalgorithm/).
