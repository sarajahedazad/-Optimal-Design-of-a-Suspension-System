I have used genetic algorithms in both MATLAB and Python for this optimization.

# Problem Description

## System

Using genetic algorithms, find K1:4 and C1:4 so that the cost function gets minimized.

try out the following conditions for MATLAB:
* Default settings
* Change population type to "bit string"
* Change population size to 500
* Change fitness scaling
*

## Cost Function



# Solution

First, we need to drive matrices of this system. You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/sarajahedazad/Optimal-Design-of-a-Suspension-System/blob/main/Using%20Lagrange%20multipliers%20to%20solve%20the%20problem.pdf).

## Python

The library used for this part is [geneticalgorithm](https://pypi.org/project/geneticalgorithm/).
